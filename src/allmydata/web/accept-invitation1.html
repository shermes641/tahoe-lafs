<h1>Accept An Invitation To Join This Grid</h1>

<p>Use this form to accept an "Invitation Code", to join an existing grid. If
you are currently a member of a grid, the two grids will be merged. The
information about who invited whom is public, and visible on your Control
Panel's grid-membership page.</p>

<form action="accept-invitation2" method="POST">
<span>Paste their invitation code here: <span>
<input type="text" name="invite_code" />

<div class="inputbox">
<span>Who is inviting you?: <input type="text" name="petname" /></span>
<span class="description">This will be used as your "pet name" for the person
inviting you. You'll see this name on your Control Panel, where you can
measure and control how much disk space they're using on your node, and see
how much space you're using on their node. This name is made public (so don't
use something like "that guy Bob who I pretend to like but really I hate his
guts"), but it is specifically for your benefit: the Control Panel will
always make it clear when it is displaying one of your Petnames.</span>
