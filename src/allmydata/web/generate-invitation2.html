<h1>Invitation Code: <span class="invite_code">%(invite_code)s</span></h1>

<p>Give this invitation code to your friend "%(petname)s" via any convenient
mechanism: email, IM, note passed from desk to desk in your 4th grade Social
Studies class hoping the teacher doesn't notice, carrier pigeon, etc.</p>

<p>Your friend should install Tahoe, run <tt>tahoe webopen --private</tt> to
get to their own Control Panel, choose the "Accept An Invitation" page, and
paste in this Invitation Code. This will cause their Tahoe node to join your
own.</p>

<p>The Invitation Code is a single-use, limited-time offer. If unclaimed, it
expires in one month. From your Control Panel, you can see <a
href="invitations">a list</a> of all pending invitations, and you can cancel
any of them.</p>
