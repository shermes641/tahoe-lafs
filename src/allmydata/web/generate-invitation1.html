<h1>Invite Someone To Join This Grid</h1>

<form action="generate-invitation2" method="POST">
<div class="inputbox">
<span>Who are you inviting?: <input type="text" name="petname" /></span>
<span class="description">This will be used as your "pet name" for the
invitee. Once they accept, you'll see this name on your Control Panel, where
you can measure and control how much disk space they're using, and see how
much space you're using on their node. This name is made public (so don't use
something like "that guy Bob who I pretend to like but really I hate his
guts"), but it is specifically for your benefit: the Control Panel will
always make it clear when it is displaying one of your Petnames.</span>

This is a good place to remember "really I hate his guts".</span>
